## package missing

To include missing packages while running the `go build` command, you can use the `go get` command to install any missing dependencies before building your project. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Get Missing Packages**: Use the `go get` command to download and install the missing packages.

    ```bash
    bashCopy codego get ./...
    ```

    This command will fetch all the dependencies required by your project, including those in subdirectories.
2.  **Build Your Project**: After fetching the dependencies, you can proceed with building your project using `go build`.

    ```bash
    bashCopy codego build
    ```

Alternatively, if you want to combine both steps into a single command, you can run:

```bash
bashCopy codego get ./... && go build
```

This command will first ensure that all dependencies are fetched and then build your project.
